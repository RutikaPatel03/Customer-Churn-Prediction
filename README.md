📊 Customer Churn Prediction System

🔍 Machine Learning based project to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) or not.



🚀 Project Overview

Customer Churn Prediction means identifying customers who are likely to cancel or stop using a company’s service based on their behavior and usage patterns.
This is a very important business problem because:

❌ Acquiring a new customer is costly

✅ Retaining an existing customer is cheaper

📉 Customer churn directly impacts company revenue

By predicting churn in advance, companies can take preventive actions such as offers, discounts, or better services to retain customers.



❓ What is Churn?

👉 Churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service or cancel their subscription.

📌 Example: If a telecom customer stops using SIM services → that customer is considered churned.

💡 Why is Churn Prediction Important?

📉 Losing customers = revenue loss

💰 Huge investment goes into acquiring customers

🔄 Replacing customers takes time & effort

🎯 Predicting churn helps companies:

Offer personalized retention strategies

Improve customer satisfaction

Reduce financial losses



📊 Business Problem Insights

👥 Total customers: 7043

🔴 Churn customers: ~27% (≈ 1869 customers)

💵 Total monthly revenue: ~$16,056,169

📉 Revenue loss due to churn: ~18% (~$2,862,927)

➡️ This shows how critical it is to predict churn early and take action.
